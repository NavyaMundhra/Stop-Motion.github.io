Stop motion animation is animation that is created using pictures/frames. In stop motion, physical objects are moved in each picture, and when you see the pictures continuously, it forms an animation! With stop motion, you can create stories, advertisements or even spread awareness. The basic process to stop motion is simple. Before filming have to set up your background, gather your props and take a camera or device that can help in filming. The process involves taking a picture of your objects/characters, moving them slightly and taking another photograph. You can create many different actions and movements in each picture. In the end, when you play the pictures continuously, it will seem like the object is moving on its own. There are different ways for stop motion (cutouts, clays & puppets or live action):
<br>
<br>
<b>Cutouts</b>- This is made out using 2D figures that have joints, giving them an effect of motion. They could be made of any flat materials (eg. paper).

<br>
<b>Clay & Puppets </b>- These are both ways of 3D stop motion. In clay animation (also known as claymation), we use clay to create our animations. The clay can be shaped differently and could be combined with other clay to create objects and animations. Puppets/figurines are used in the same way.

<b>Live Action </b>- In Live Action, real people/animals are used to create a stop motion film, but with a twist. It can be used to mimic things that you cannot do at the time, making it possible to do at home.
